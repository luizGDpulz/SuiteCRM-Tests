**Date:** 2025-04-24

---

### **Title of the Test:** Sales Module Integration

### **Description**

This test aims to verify the ability of the system to manage sales opportunities and ensure integration with related modules such as Contacts and Tasks.

### **Objective**

To validate whether the system allows for the creation and management of sales opportunities and to confirm that this process is integrated with other core modules.

### **What is Being Tested**

- Existence and functionality of the Sales module
- Integration between Sales, Contacts, and Tasks modules

### **Prerequisites**

- Access to SuiteCRM with permission to view and create Opportunities, Contacts, and Tasks.
- An active CRM instance at [http://crm.alunostds.dev.br](http://crm.alunostds.dev.br).

### **Test Procedure**

1. Navigate to the Sales or Opportunities module within SuiteCRM.
2. Attempt to create a new opportunity.
3. Try to associate it with an existing contact or task.
4. Observe the availability and behavior of related functionalities.

### **Expected Result**

The system should:
- Provide access to a Sales or Opportunities module.
- Allow the creation of sales opportunities.
- Support integration with Contacts and Tasks.

### **Actual Result**

❌ The system does not include or support a Sales module. It is currently not possible to create or manage opportunities or test any integration with Contacts or Tasks.

### **Result Analysis**

❌ The test failed. The system lacks a Sales module, making this functionality unavailable. This restricts the CRM’s utility for organizations that rely on opportunity management.

### **Error Description**

- Missing functionality: Sales/Opportunities module not present in current SuiteCRM deployment.
- As a result, no integration with Contacts or Tasks could be verified.

### **Evidence**

- Module navigation conducted through [http://crm.alunostds.dev.br](http://crm.alunostds.dev.br)
