### **Title of the Test:** Interface Responsiveness on Various Devices

### **Description**

This test evaluates the responsiveness of the SuiteCRM user interface across different screen sizes and devices.

### **Objective**

To ensure that the interface adapts correctly when viewed on devices of varying screen sizes, including desktop, tablet, and smartphone.

### **What is Being Tested**

Responsiveness and adaptability of the UI components.

### **Prerequisites**

- Access to a supported browser (Google Chrome).
- Access to the SuiteCRM instance at [http://crm.alunostds.dev.br](http://crm.alunostds.dev.br).
- Access to developer tools for simulating screen sizes.

### **Test Procedure**

1. Open SuiteCRM in Google Chrome on a Windows system.
2. Resize the browser window manually to simulate smaller screen sizes.
3. Open Chrome Developer Tools (F12).
4. Use the device toolbar to simulate mobile and tablet screens.
5. Observe the layout and rendering of the interface.

### **Expected Result**

The interface should adapt smoothly to various screen sizes without distortion, maintaining usability and accessibility.

### **Actual Result**

### **Result Analysis**

✅ The test passed successfully. The interface displayed correctly on all simulated devices and screen sizes. Some view breaking may occur at exotic resolutions that are not used by common devices, but this does not affect typical user experiences.
