### **Test Case 12 – Email Integration**

**Date:** 2025-04-23

---

### **Title of the Test:** Email Integration

### **Description**

This test aims to verify the system’s capability to send notifications via email, ensuring that messages are dispatched and received as expected through the configured mail server.

### **Objective**

To test the functionality of the email notification feature and confirm that it integrates properly with an SMTP server.

### **What is Being Tested**

Email notification functionality through the system’s SMTP configuration.

### **Prerequisites**

- Access to the SuiteCRM instance at [http://crm.alunostds.dev.br](http://crm.alunostds.dev.br).
- A user account with permission to access email settings or trigger email events.
- A properly configured SMTP mail server.

### **Test Procedure**

1. Navigate to the Email Settings or Notification Trigger section in SuiteCRM.
2. Attempt to send a test email or trigger a notification that relies on the email system.
3. Monitor the system for confirmation of email dispatch.

### **Expected Result**

The system should successfully dispatch the email, and the recipient should receive it shortly after. Confirmation or status logs should indicate success.

### **Actual Result**

The system was unable to send emails. Upon inspection, it was confirmed that the SMTP mail server is **not configured**, and therefore the email functionality could not be tested.

### **Result Analysis**

❌ The test failed due to missing configuration. The SMTP settings must be configured before this functionality can be properly tested.

### **Error Description (if applicable)**

- SMTP Mail Server is not configured in the system.
- Email dispatch functions do not execute and return an error or fail silently.

### **Evidence**

- No evidence required. Functionality could not be tested due to configuration absence.
